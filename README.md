# React-JS

Hey their, this repo consist of many ReactJS projects which help to build small components in your production.
Every project is placed is seperate folder for user convenient.

Makesure that you set up all dependency in your runtime to run the project. For each project, the dependency 
are mentioned in the package.json file gothrough the file for every component you work with.

Before runing the command `npm start` makesure you run  `npm install` to download the dependency in your
runtime. In somecase the version of the dependency may varies. So check it while running the code.

Happy Coding!!!
